# What is the Project all about?
In Egypt and over the world, Cancer has become a deadly disease and more and more people are suffering from Cancer a survey says one in every 30 women suffer from this disease in their lifetime so basically the project was first thought of because of the increase in cases of breast cancer and one thing which is very important that if we can detect the Cancer at an early stage then there is an increased chance of it getting cured. This project lays a foundation for making the detection of cancer automated so that more and more people can get it diagnosed early so as to get cured.

# How is it implemented?
 Designed and implemented a responsive dashboard serving as a cross-platform interface for efficient patient 
data management and analytics.
 Utilized technologies including Flutter, Firebase, cloud services, and Flask API to ensure seamless functionality.
 Employed advanced machine learning algorithms including data analysis and deep learning techniques to 
enhance the accuracy of cancer detection.
 Integrated multiple imaging modalities such as mammograms, ultrasound, and MRI for comprehensive patient 
state prediction.
 Generated professional reports conforming to global standards, facilitating effective communication of 
diagnostic findings.
 Implemented a chatbot as a decision support system, leveraging AI to provide diagnostic insights and 
resources based on examination results.

# How to make the project work?
Setup: Clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory.
Install Dependencies: Install the necessary dependencies using the package manager (e.g., pip for Python, npm for JavaScript).
Configure Firebase: Set up Firebase for authentication, database, and storage by adding the configuration details in the project.
Run the Backend: Start the Flask API server to handle requests and process data.
Launch the Dashboard: Use Flutter to build and run the dashboard on your desired platform (web, Android, iOS).
Integrate Imaging Devices: Ensure that the imaging devices (mammogram, ultrasound, MRI) are correctly configured to send data to the system.
Deploy: Optionally, deploy the application to a cloud service for broader access and scalability.
